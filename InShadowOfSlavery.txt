	* Northern Black Society in 17 th century had an incredible in balance of 
	  communities of color versus Europeans
	  	- there was mostly European Americans 
	  	- black community was small and they normally lived and worked in close
	  	  proximity to whites 
	  	- most were directly from the Caribbean; some had been born there 
	  	- Massachusetts preferred children because they were malleable 
	  		* easy to train

  		- in close contact with the European Americans 
  		- worked with indentured servants 
  		- the family that is so central to west and central Africa is not a unit
  		  that they can form at this time
	* Europeans are all fighting over the slave trade 
	* they stop coming because they can not easily traverse the atlantic
