+ trying to figure out what the impact of the revolution on African American's
+ impact of the revolution
	- British citizens were entitled to the rights of taxation with representation
	- the enlightenment had just happened
	- natural right to be free
	- the petition at the king's council for the right to be free
	- some sue for their freedom
	- slave petitioners to really explain what it means to be enslaved
- Jefferson condemned the British
- they begin informing slave holders of what slavery really is
- January 1773 - people begin to actually rebel and fight against Britain
- lacking complete powerlessness and relationships
- those who are enslaved and expanding and demanding their freedom based upon natural rights doctrine
- drawing upon enlightenment principles and demanding their freedom
- using this revolutionary language and arguing that real slavery is actually about economics and social interest
- impact of the revolution is important in the north; slave rebels attempt in Virginia to petition for their rights but it is not successful
- The kings council is appointed by the king and this is who they are petitioning to
	- these petitioners are important for helping understand some of the ideals that are about liberty to help the cause of freeing slaves
- slaves had to figure out which side it was better to fight for
- others purchase themselves out of slavery
- _**Richard Allen **_ purchased himself out of slavery and became minister of black methodist Episcopal church
- Boston Massacre - the double death of Crispus Attucks; he has a double death because he is killed and the rhetoric that was used to argue for freedom and his story was eliminated and lost in this argument
	- used as a propaganda tool to get people to fight the British
	- Northern states establish gradual abolition laws
- there are abolition societies in the upper south than there are in the North
	- there are some proposals of gradual abolition
-	why not keep slavery
the north is never fully dependent on slave labor
- economic and political interest and the gradual laws is the way in which those who are enslaved gain freedom but to being they do not necessarily exist
 - Virginia was the first state to do so
 - March 1780 any child of an enslaved mother is to be free in name only; she will be the indentured servant of the slave holder or can sell their labor to someone else
 - in reality no one is free
 - property and the ownership took precedence over these high ideals
 - property took precedence over the humanity of these enslaved people more than it took precedence over these ideals that they would apply to everyone
	- you can not be free without property
- when we turn to the south 	
	- it continues expands and thrives
- quakers establish a policy and gives slaves plots of land and work on it and subsist as farmers
- families are being taken and females are just as important and they begin moving west to plant cotton and tobacco
